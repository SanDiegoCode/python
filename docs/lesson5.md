# Introduction to Methods### What are methods?<b>Methods</b> are blocks of code that are grouped together that can take in an input and give something out.Confused? Let's look at some examples to clarify.Imagine a vending machine, in which we ```input``` money and we are ```returned``` with a soda. In code, this would like this:	def vendingMachine(money):	if (money == "1"):		return "pepsi"	else:		return "not enough money!"But what about in situations that don't require an input? For example, when pressing a button, we give no input -- we just press it.In code:		def pressButton():		return "You pressed a button"Methods can be extremely powerful, as it lets us group a lot of code that we might use often. In this next example, we've written a program that takes in input from the user, and tells whether it is raining or not.	def weatherStatus(city):	if (city == "San Diego"):		return "sunny"	else:		return "not as good as San Diego"	while True:		cityInput = input("What City would you like weather data for?")		status = weatherStatus(cityInput)		print ("The weather in " + cityInput + " is " + status)**Challenge**Make a function that randomly selects an item from a list. In this function, you define a *list* of strings (name of items, these could be whatever you want). This function takes in no input, but returns a random string from the list.
